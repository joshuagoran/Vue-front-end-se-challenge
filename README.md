Originally part of an interview exercise - I hadn't written much Vue code before this, so it was fun practice! See [NasaMarsPhotos.vue](https://github.com/joshuagoran/Vue-front-end-se-challenge/blob/master/src/components/Exercise-3/NasaMarsPhotos.vue) for a component I wrote from scratch that fetches and displays Mars Curiosity rover photos from NASA's public API.
