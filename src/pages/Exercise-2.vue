        Exercise 2
      </h2>
      <p>
        You're building an application that allows users to modify some text via a text input. The user can save their input and persist it for the next time they visit the page. There's just one problem: users have given feedback that they sometimes navigate away from the page unintentionally and lose their work! You've been asked to resolve the following user stories to fix this.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <strong>A user can...</strong>
        <li>
          see a dialog box reminding them to save their work before they navigate away from the in-app page
          <ul>
            <li>
              the dialog should contain both a button that will allow the user to save their work and a button that will allow the user to discard their changes
            </li>
            <li>
              no matter the choice a user makes, they should be navigated to the next page
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          see their previously saved work when they navigate to page 1 or page 2
          <ul>
            <li>
              if a user chooses not to save their input, the saved input on the next page should reflect their previously saved work
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <InfoBox>
        <em>Tip:</em> The "pages" in question are those within the window to the right (or below, depending on screen size); you don't need to implement persistent storage for browser-level navigation (so no need to use <code>localStorage</code> for anything).
      </InfoBox>

      <p>
        Modify the components as you see fit to accomplish the above stories.
